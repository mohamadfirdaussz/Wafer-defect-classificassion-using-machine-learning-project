## Overview

This project implements a **scientifically rigorous, 5-stage machine learning pipeline** to classify defect patterns in semiconductor wafer maps using the **WM-811K dataset**. The pipeline is designed with a "Gatekeeper" architecture to ensure **zero data leakage** and features advanced techniques for handling **severe class imbalance** (~90% "none" class).

### Why This Project Matters

In semiconductor manufacturing, early defect detection is critical for:
- **Reducing production costs** by identifying faulty processes
- **Improving yield rates** through systematic quality control
- **Enabling predictive maintenance** via pattern recognition

---

---

## Research Objectives

This project addresses three primary research objectives:

1. **Optimal Feature Set Identification**: To identify the optimal feature set for each machine learning algorithm by evaluating different feature combinations through multi-track feature selection (RFE, Random Forest Importance, and Lasso regularization).

2. **Algorithm Performance Comparison**: To compare the performance of various traditional machine learning algorithms (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) for wafer defect classification using consistent evaluation metrics.

3. **Model Generalizability Assessment**: To assess the generalizability of the trained models by testing their performance on a combined dataset composed of multiple individual defect datasets, ensuring robust real-world applicability.

---

## Key Features

- **Zero Data Leakage**: Test set is locked away before any preprocessing, ensuring honest evaluation
- **Hybrid Class Balancing**: Combines SMOTE (upsampling) for minorities and undersampling for majorities
- **Multi-Track Feature Selection**: Three parallel approaches (RFE, RF Importance, Lasso) compete to find optimal features
- **High-Dimensional Feature Engineering**: Expands 66 base features to 8,500+ interaction terms
- **One-Click Execution**: Automated batch script handles dependencies and runs entire pipeline
- **Scientific Rigor**: 3-fold stratified cross-validation with locked test sets
